This API favors small, verifiable behaviors over sweeping feature lists.

## Contract stability

- Zod schemas validate input and serialize output so the contract is consistent.
- The runtime path stays short and explicit to reduce hidden side effects.

## Auth boundaries

- Clerk verifies JWTs, and the API never stores passwords.
- Public reads are open, while writes require valid auth.

## Testing and uptime

- Tests run with Vitest + Supertest to cover request behavior end to end.
- The `GET /health` endpoint gives a fast readiness signal for deploys.
- In tests (`NODE_ENV=test`), the server does not auto-start.
